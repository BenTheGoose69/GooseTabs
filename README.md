## Architecture

The app uses a column-based data model for proper alignment of multi-character notes:

```
GuitarTab
  └── sections: List<TabSection>
        ├── label (Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc.)
        ├── repeatCount
        ├── stringNames [e, B, G, D, A, E]
        └── bars: List<TabMeasure>
              └── columns: List<TabColumn>
                    └── notes: List<String>
```

Each `TabColumn` represents a vertical slice across all strings at one position, ensuring notes align correctly even when they have different widths (e.g., "5b7" vs "3").
